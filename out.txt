* Machine Learning Examples

To see end-to-end examples of the interactive machine learning analyses that Colaboratory makes possible, check out these

tutorials using models from TensorFlow Hub.

A few featured examples:

e Retraining an Image Classifier: Build a Keras model on top of a pre-trained image classifier to distinguish flowers.
Text Classification: Classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative.

Style Transfer: Use deep learning to transfer style between images.
Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder Q&A: Use a machine learning model to answer questions from the SQUAD

 

 

dataset.
